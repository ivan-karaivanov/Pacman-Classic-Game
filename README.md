# Pac-Man Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using Turtle graphics.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Right, Left, Up, Down) to control Pac-Man.
2. Eat all the white dots in the maze to increase your score.
3. Avoid the red ghosts. If a ghost catches Pac-Man, the game is over.

## Customization

You can customize the game by changing the code:

1. Modify the `tiles` list to change the maze layout.
2. Adjust the `ghosts` list to change the number of ghosts.
3. Change Pac-Man's starting position with the `pacman` vector.
